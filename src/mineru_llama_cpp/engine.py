# "any Unicode codepoint, repeated" -- llama.cpp's grammar-constrained sampler
# decodes each candidate token's bytes and rejects invalid UTF-8 sequences
# (see llama-grammar.cpp's decode_utf8()/llama_grammar_match_partial_char()).
# Valid characters may span tokens, so a forced length stop still needs
# boundary-safe decoding in the binding layer. Occasionally (observed on
# a Q8_0-quantized model, dense/high-resolution pages) the model samples a
# token that produces a broken multi-byte sequence, which renders as U+FFFD
# and breaks the downstream peg-native chat-format parser
# ("The model produced output that does not match the expected ... format").
# This wildcard grammar doesn't constrain the *structure* of the output
# (MinerU's <|box_start|> etc. markers and content are still whatever the
# model produces) -- it only removes the invalid-byte failure mode from the
# sampling candidate set.
#
# Applied in _build_body (below) as a *default*, the same way SamplingParams
# .stop is defaulted: only set when the caller hasn't already put a "grammar"
# key in the body. SamplingParams has no grammar field today (see its module
# docstring), so in practice this is always the effective value -- but if a
# grammar field is added to SamplingParams later, that value should win over
# this default rather than being silently overridden by it.

        n_ctx_seq: the context length for a *single* slot/sequence (this maps
            onto llama.cpp's internal n_ctx_seq, "context for a single
            sequence" -- not the total n_ctx). The total context is derived
            internally as n_ctx_seq * n_parallel, and the KV cache is
            hard-partitioned (kv_unified=false) so each slot gets its own
            private n_ctx_seq cells -- no slot can be starved by its peers.
            Default 0 means "the model's training context length"
            (n_ctx_train), so most callers only ever need to tune n_parallel.
            Values are rounded up to a multiple of 256 to match llama.cpp's
            own internal padding, keeping the effective per-slot context
            exactly equal to what's passed here.
        n_parallel: number of concurrent slots, same as llama.cpp's
            -np/--parallel. Default 4 matches what llama-server itself
            resolves to when --parallel is left at its own "auto" default
            (tools/server/server.cpp). Total KV = n_ctx_seq * n_parallel.
        verbosity: threshold for llama.cpp's internal logging, using the
            same LOG_LEVEL_* constants as llama.cpp's own -lv/--verbosity
            CLI flag (see mineru_llama_cpp.verbosity). Default is
            LOG_LEVEL_WARN (llama.cpp's own default is LOG_LEVEL_INFO,
            which is noisier than most embedders want -- pass
            LOG_LEVEL_INFO explicitly to match llama.cpp's own default).
        n_threads: CPU threads for generation, same as llama.cpp's
            -t/--threads. Default -1 auto-detects the usable core count.
